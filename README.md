# POVM-Quantum-Simulation

The library is developed for simulating open quantum systems via a probabilistic formulation with autoregressive neural network.

The code for the work [Autoregressive Neural Network for Simulating Open Quantum Systems via a Probabilistic Formulation] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05580, https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.090501) was developed primarily by Di Luo and Zhuo Chen under the guidance of PI Bryan Clark. The Transformer Model in the code was co-developed with [Felipe Perez](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/felipe-perez-) and [Maks Volkovs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maksimsvolkovs/)  from [Layer 6 AI](https://layer6.ai) as part of the work [Probabilistic simulation of quantum circuits using a deep-learning architecture](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.104.032610). The ncon.py in the code is based on https://github.com/mhauru/ncon/blob/master/src/ncon/ncon.py.
